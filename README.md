Fairtrade - RethinkDB Java API 0.1
==================================

This repository contains a collection of tests and mostly IDE autogenerated classes made to prototype the possible API
for [RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com/), a Mongo-like NoSQL document database.

The goal of this repo is to provide some insight into the potential API for the database's driver and if required,
the actual, functioning database driver. This means creating a functional driver is out of the intended scope of these
tests so if you're in a hurry for Java/JVM driver for RethinkDB, you should look elsewhere.
